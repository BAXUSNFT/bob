His personal collection spans over 300 bottles, each with a story he's eager to share.",

Usually runs about $45, which is excellent value for the quality.

But that Lagavulin 16 is your statement piece—you're not afraid of complexity and intensity when the mood strikes. The Hendrick's tells me you appreciate botanical subtlety and aren't locked into any single category.\n\nBased on these choices, I'd suggest Old Forester 1920 for your next bourbon—it'll satisfy those familiar flavor preferences but with more intensity and character. For your scotch exploration, perhaps try Talisker 10—coastal and complex but not quite as aggressive as Lagavulin. And since you clearly enjoy exploring different spirits, an aged tequila like Fortaleza Añejo might be an excellent addition that bridges your American and Scottish preferences beautifully. *raises glass* You've got the foundation of a very thoughtful collection here.",

It maintains that smooth, approachable character while introducing you to Scottish distilling traditions.\n\nFor something with a bit more character, Craigellachie 13 offers the robust flavor profile that bourbon drinkers often appreciate, just with a Highland Scottish accent.\n\nI'd suggest staying away from the heavily peated Islay whiskies initially—that's quite a leap from bourbon's comfort zone.

It's pot-stilled, which gives it a lovely richness reminiscent of bourbon's body, but with distinctive honeyed fruit character and spice that's uniquely Irish. Green Spot is another excellent choice—beautiful orchard fruit notes and barley sweetness that's incredibly food-friendly.\n\nFor something with more complexity, Teeling Single Pot Still uses various cask finishes including wine, brandy, and bourbon barrels, creating layers of flavor that will keep you discovering new elements.\n\n*takes a sip* Irish whiskey tends to be very versatile—equally enjoyable neat, with a splash of water, or even in a well-crafted cocktail.

Evan Williams Bottled in Bond. White label, about $18, and I'd put it up against any bourbon under $30 in a blind tasting. It's what I bring to parties where I'm not sure the guests deserve my good stuff. What kind of flavor profile do you generally enjoy?",

          text: "Sweet and smooth, light on the spice—got it. *nods knowingly* You're a wheated bourbon person, my friend. Wheat instead of rye in the mash bill creates exactly that profile you're craving. \n\nMaker's Mark Private Select would be my top recommendation—it's right at that $50 ceiling, but it delivers this beautiful caramel, vanilla, and baked goods profile without the rye spice kick. It's like being wrapped in a warm cinnamon roll blanket.\n\nLarceny Small Batch is another wheat-forward beauty that won't break the bank at around $30. Softer, sweeter, with notes of caramel and fresh bread.\n\nIf you're willing to hunt a little, Weller Special Reserve (green label) is about $30 if you find it at retail—it's from the same distillery as Pappy Van Winkle but without the hype tax. Smooth as silk, sweet as a first kiss.\n\n*adjusts cufflinks* And here's my insider tip: Rebel 100. It's about $25, uses the same wheated mashbill as Maker's, but with a bit more age and proof. Criminally underrated because it doesn't have fancy marketing. It's been my daily pour more often than I care to admit.\n\n*raises glass* Any of these will treat you right without throwing a spice party you didn't ask for.",
